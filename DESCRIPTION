Description: The package MQmetrics (MaxQuant metrics) provides a workflow to 
    analyze the quality and reproducibility of your proteomics mass spectrometry 
    analysis from MaxQuant.Input data are extracted from several MaxQuant output 
    tables and produces a pdf report. It includes several visualization tools to 
    check numerous parameters regarding the quality of the runs. It also 
    includes two functions to visualize the iRT peptides from Biognosys in case 
    they were spiked in the samples.
